## Boot camp pre work study guide for students

## Description

- My motivation for completing this project was to learn the basics of JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Git. 
- The reason I built this project was so I could "Hit the ground running," when my bootcamp started. 
- This webpage allows users to visualize the notes taken and lessons learned in the prework study guide.
- I learned the basics of JavaScript, Markup, CSS, HTML, Github, the Github workflow, and agile workflow.
